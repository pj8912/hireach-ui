    Children are an integral part in accessing Internet. The Internet offers kids and youth many opportunities for learning, productive entertainment, and to gain personal knowledge. But there are a lot of risks that children face online. Working together, we can make the online environment a much safer and rewarding experience for children. Parental Control and Filtering softwares like OpenDNSFamilyShield, MinorMonitor, Qustodio, Kaspersky Safe Kids, SURFWATCH, NETNANNY, CYBERPATROL, CYBER SITTER, NET GUARDIAN etc. can help keep children from inappropriate online areas. Like the rest of the world, the Internet may contain some material that is inappropriate for young audiences. There are a number of ways you can control what your child can see and do online. Filtering tools are a great way to tailor your childâ€™s online experience, but there is no substitute for parental involvement online
